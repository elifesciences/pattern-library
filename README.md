[![Build Status](https://alfred.elifesciences.org/buildStatus/icon?job=prod-pattern-library)](https://alfred.elifesciences.org/job/prod-pattern-library/)
# Note
This pattern library uses as its starting point  `https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-php` with HEAD at sha e52ced8551000b7c6b97a01f419e2af8a07e2fd1

# Quickstart

This sets up PatternLab to generate the html from mustache templates, and Gulp to handle transformation
of scss to css, and other various build-related tasks. Note that artefacts generated from running Gulp are
inputs for the generation of PatternLab files, so Gulp needs to run before PatternLab. When developing,
itâ€™s recommended to run watch tasks for both, which will take care of this.

##### Note : You may encounter some errors and need to install [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start) manually.

# Docker setup

```
docker-compose build
```

(re)builds all images:

- `elifesciences/pattern-library_assets-builder` is a Node-based image for Gulp usage
- `elifesciences/pattern-library_assets` is a lightweight image containing `assets/`
- `elifesciences/pattern-library_ui-builder` is a PHP-based image for generation of the UI
- `elifesciences/pattern-library` is a nginx-based image serving the UI
- `elifesciences/pattern-library_ci` is used to run tests
- an anonymous `selenium` image extension.

```
docker-compose up
```

runs containers so that the static website is accessible through a browser at http://localhost:8889

```
docker-compose run --rm ci ./project_tests.sh
```

runs all tests.

To create an exploratory session with the browser used by the Selenium test suite:

```
docker-compose up -d
curl -v localhost:4/wd/hub/session -d '{"desiredCapabilities":{"browserName":"firefox"}}'
```

Connect to this browser by using a VNC client (such as `vinagre`) on `localhost:5900`, with password `secret`. You can visit the pattern-library static website at `http://ui`.

For a local build, run:

```
ENVIRONMENT=development docker-compose build assets
```

To watch for changes, run:

```
docker-compose build  # only necessary after switching branch or installing new dependencies
bin/watch
```

Changes to `assets/js` (and similar) will be propagated to the `gulp watch` process. Changes to `source/_patterns` (and similar) will be propagated to the `php core/builder.php --watch` process.

You can pass options to the underlying gulp:

```
bin/watch --sass-lint=false
```

To run additional gulp command in the same container where `gulp:watch` is running:

```
$ docker exec -it pattern-library-gulp-watch /bin/bash
elife@...$ node_modules/.bin/gulp test:unit
```

The watch loop keeps a read-only host folder up-to-date with the latest assets:

```
$ ls .container_source_assets/
css  fonts  img  js
```

Exit from this script with `Ctrl+C`.

To watch a particular test in a browser:

```
$ bin/tests-watch test/hypothesisopener.html
```

Visit the URL that is printed out:

```
http://localhost:3000/test/hypothesisopener.html
```

The browser will refresh and rerun the test upon changes to it. Exit from this script with `Ctrl+C`.

# Automatic setup
From the root directory run
```
$ ./bin/dev
```
This will install and run the commands needed to get started, starting a web server on port 8889. If you need a custom port pass this as the first argument:
```
$ ./bin/dev 1234
```
This will run on localhost:1234 

You should be good to go, open your browser and you will see the pattern lab.

# Manual setup (This may or may not work)

## 1. Set up PatternLab

- Clone pattern library: `git clone git@github.com:elifesciences/pattern-library.git`
- Create the public folder: `cd pattern-library && mkdir public`
- Copy dependencies: `cp -r ./core/styleguide ./public/`

## 2. Set up and run Gulp

- Install required npm packages with `npm install`
- Run `npx gulp` to build the css & js files.
- then run `npx gulp watch` to watch for changes to files or do both in one fell swoop with `npx gulp && npx gulp watch` (the watch task on its own will not compile your assets until a file is changed).
- run `npx gulp local:test:unit --mocha-grep=something` to pass the `--grep` option to mocha and run a subset of tests.
- if generating files intended for website production, invoke with the production flag, like this: `npx gulp --environment production`. The minifies css & js files.

## 3. Generate PatternLab

To run a **one-off** generation of the patterns, it's `php ./core/builder.php -g`

Alternatively to set up a **watch task** for pattern generation, run `php ./core/builder.php -w` 

## 4. Verify the setup

The static files defining the patterns should now be available in the `public` directory.

Verify the generated static site by serving the `public` folder locally. One quick and dirty way to do this is to run the built in PHP server in the public folder:

  1. Open a new terminal
  2. `cd` into the `public` directory
  3. run the webserver `php -S localhost:8889`
  4. in a browser go to `http://localhost:8889` and verify you can see the generated patterns.

# Using patterns

For patterns that are being exposed as resources (ie the Mustache template can be used in an application), there is a YAML file located alongside the template. This contains details of any CSS files that it requires, and a JSON Schema that documents what input is expected.

You can run `bin/validate`, which checks all data files for a pattern against the schema.

There is also a list of js file dependencies for each pattern, but individual js files have not yet been implemented and so these lists are currently all empty.

# Running tests

## Selenium

```
npx wdio wdio-local.conf.js --spec ./test-selenium/hello.spec.js
```

will run a single test file. This set up relies on your locally installed Firefox.

```
npx gulp test:selenium:local
```

will instead run all the Selenium tests.

```
npx gulp test:selenium
```

is used inside the pattern-library VM and should not be used elsewhere.

# Notes

All assets paths in Mustache templates must be wrapped in `{{#assetRewrite}}`, which allows implementations to rewrite the path for cache-busting purposes. The path must also be prepended by `{{assetsPath}}`.
