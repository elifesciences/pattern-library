# Note
This pattern library uses as its starting point  `https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-php` with HEAD at sha e52ced8551000b7c6b97a01f419e2af8a07e2fd1

# Quickstart

This sets up PatternLab to generate the html from mustache templates, and Gulp to handle transformation
of scss to css, and other various build-related tasks. Note that artefacts generated from running Gulp are
inputs for the generation of PatternLab files, so Gulp needs to run before PatternLab. When developing,
itâ€™s recommended to run watch tasks for both, which will take care of this.

## 1. Dependencies
You'll need:

 - PHP (for Patternlab)
 - nodejs (for gulp)
 - ruby (to handle the `compass` gem that underpins `gulp-compass` (see https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-compass).

Then install compass: `gem install compass`

## 1. Set up PatternLab

- Clone pattern library: `git clone git@github.com:elifesciences/pattern-library.git`
- Create the public folder: `cd pattern-library && mkdir public`
- Copy dependencies: `cp -r ./core/styleguide ./public/`

## 2. Set up and run Gulp

- if you have not used gulp before, then install the gulp cli globally with `npm install --global gulp-cli`
- install required npm packages with `npm install`
- run `gulp` to build the css & js files.
- then run `gulp watch` to watch for changes to files or do both in one fell swoop with `gulp && gulp watch` (the watch task on its own will not compile your assets until a file is changed).
- if generating files intended for website production, invoke with the production flag, like this: `gulp --environment production`. The only difference at the moment is to minify css files, it may be used for more later.

## 3. Generate PatternLab

- Run `php ./core/builder.php -g`, and check no errors in the output.

## 4. Verify the setup

The static files defining the patterns should now be available in the `public` directory.

Verify the generated static site by serving the `public` folder locally. One quick and dirty way to do this is to run the built in PHP server in the public folder:

  1. Open a new terminal
  2. `cd` into the `public` directory
  3. run the webserver `php -S localhost:8889`
  4. in a browser go to `http://localhost:8889` and verify you can see the generated patterns.

# Using patterns

For patterns that are being exposed as resources (ie the Mustache template can be used in an application), there is a YAML file located alongside the template. This contains details of any CSS/JS files that it requires, and a JSON Schema that documents what input is expected.

You can run `bin/validate`, which checks all data files for a pattern against the schema.
