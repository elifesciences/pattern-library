He was trained as a medical doctor at Zagreb University and obtained his PhD in molecular biology with Joseph Schlessinger. His career is focused on studying intracellular signaling initially via protein tyrosine kinases where he revealed how multiple monoubiquitination controls EGFR endocytosis. His lab has pioneered a concept of Ubiquitin as a multivalent cellular signal that regulates multitude of physiological and pathophysiological processes including DNA repair, inflammation, cancer, infection and proteasomal degradation. Ivan’s group also provided structural and functional evidence for a new type of Ub chains that are Met1-linked (called linear ubiquitination) in promoting the NF-kB signaling. His current interests focus on selective autophagy, which is essential for the clearance of protein aggregates, pathogens, and damaged mitochondria from the cell. He has received many awards for his work including the AACR Award for Outstanding Achievement in Cancer Research, the Award of European Association for Cancer Research, the Hans Krebs Prize, the Leibniz Award and the Ernst Jung Award in Medicine. He is a Member of the German Academy for Sciences Leopoldina, Academia Europaea, Croatian Academy of Medical Sciences and the European Molecular Biology Organization.</p><dl><dt>Expertise</dt><dd>Biochemistry</dd><dd>Cell Biology</dd><dt>Research focus</dt><dd>ubiquitination</dd><dd>autophagy</dd><dd>endocytosis</dd><dd>inflammation</dd><dd>cancer biology</dd></dl>"

Since 1990, he has been an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Kuriyan completed undergraduate studies in chemistry at Juniata College, Huntingdon, PA. His doctoral research, on the dynamics of proteins, was carried out at MIT, under the guidance of Greg Petsko and Martin Karplus (Harvard University). Kuriyan’s research is aimed at understanding the structure and mechanism of the enzymes and molecular switches that carry out cellular signal transduction and DNA replication. His laboratory uses x-ray crystallography to determine the three-dimensional structures of proteins involved in signaling and replication, as well as biochemical, biophysical, and computational analyses to elucidate mechanisms. Kuriyan was elected to the US National Academy of Sciences in 2001.</p>"

After completing his postdoctoral studies at Harvard Medical School, Li joined NIBS as an Assistant Investigator in 2007 and rose to the rank of Investigator in 2015. His team at NIBS identified a liver bile acids transporter (sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide, NTCP) as a functional receptor for Hepatitis B and D virus.

His research focuses on a central station of the secretory pathway, the Golgi complex. Specifically, his work has resulted in the identification of the machinery required for the sorting and packaging of secretory cargoes. His recent work has uncovered a novel secretory routing that bypasses the conventional pathway of protein secretion. He has identified new genes required for the export of bulky collagens and the regulated secretion of mucins. He received his BSc from Stirling University and was a Pirie–Reid scholar at Oxford; a Damon Runyon Walter Winchell and an American Cancer Society postdoctoral fellow at Stanford; and Basil O’Conner scholar, established Investigator of the American Heart Association, and Senior Investigator of Sandler’s Foundation for Asthma at UC San Diego.
