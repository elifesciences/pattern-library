Here, we propose that human observers are capable of generating their own feedback signals by monitoring internal decision variables. We investigated this hypothesis in a visual perceptual learning task using fMRI and confidence reports as a measure for this monitoring process. Employing a novel computational model in which learning is guided by confidence-based reinforcement signals, we found that mesolimbic brain areas encoded both anticipation and prediction error of confidence‚Äîin remarkable similarity to previous findings for external reward-based feedback. We demonstrate that the model accounts for choice and confidence reports and show that the mesolimbic confidence prediction error modulation derived through the model predicts individual learning success. These results provide a mechanistic neurobiological explanation for learning without external feedback by augmenting reinforcement models with confidence-based feedback.</p>"}

The most common culprit is a strain of the virus called influenza type A subtype H3N2. One reason that so many people become infected each year is that this virus evolves rapidly. Within a few years, proteins on the surface of the virus known as antigens become less recognizable to the immune system of a person who has been previously infected. This means that the person can become ill with the virus again because their immune system cannot mount an effective response to the evolved virus strain.</p>"},

The first is by a single mutation that has a big effect on the antigens in viruses that only carry a few harmful mutations, but these large mutations would not happen very often. Another route may be through more common mutations that have only a small or moderate benefit, which would allow the virus to become more common in the population before it acquires a beneficial mutation with a much greater effect. The third possibility is that a large beneficial mutation may arise in viruses that have many harmful mutations. These harmful mutations may initially limit the ability of the virus to spread, but over time, some of these harmful mutations may then be lost.</p>"},

It was first identified together with TRAF1 as a component of TNF receptor-2 and then TNF receptor-1 (TNFR1) signalling complexes (<a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib50\" rel=\"#bib50\" title=\"\">Rothe et al., 1994</a>; <a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib54\" rel=\"#bib54\" title=\"\">Shu et al., 1996</a>). TRAF2, like most other TRAFs, contains a RING domain, several zinc fingers, a TRAF-N, and a conserved TRAF-C domain which is responsible for oligomerisation and receptor binding through its MATH region (<a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib60\" rel=\"#bib60\">Takeuchi et al., 1996</a>; <a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib63\" rel=\"#bib63\">Uren and Vaux, 1996</a>).</p>"},

However TRAF2 recruits E3 ligases such as cIAPs to TNFR1-SC and these have also been shown to be able to ubiquitylate RIPK1 and regulate TNF signalling (<a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib13\" rel=\"#bib13\">Dynek et al., 2010</a>; <a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib34\" rel=\"#bib34\">Mahoney et al., 2008</a>; <a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib66\" rel=\"#bib66\">Varfolomeev et al., 2008</a>; <a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib68\" rel=\"#bib68\">Vince et al., 2009</a>).

Although activation of NF-Œ∫B was restored in <em>Traf2</em><sup>-/-</sup><em>Traf5</em><sup>-/-</sup> cells by re-expression of wild type TRAF2, it was not restored when the cells were reconstituted with TRAF2 point mutants that could not bind cIAPs (<a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib68\" rel=\"#bib68\">Vince et al., 2009</a>; <a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib79\" rel=\"#bib79\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>). These data, together with a wealth of different lines of evidence showing that cIAPs are critical E3 ligases required for TNF-induced canonical NF-Œ∫B (<a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib5\" rel=\"#bib5\">Blackwell et al., 2013</a>; <a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib21\" rel=\"#bib21\">Haas et al., 2009</a>; <a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib56\" rel=\"#bib56\">Silke, 2011</a>), support the idea that the main function of TRAF2 in TNF-induced NF-Œ∫B is to recruit cIAPs to the TNFR1-SC.

Moreover, TRAF2 inhibits non-canonical NF-Œ∫B signalling (<a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib18\" rel=\"#bib18\">Grech et al., 2004</a>; <a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib78\" rel=\"#bib78\">Zarnegar et al., 2008</a>) and this function requires the RING domain of TRAF2 to induce proteosomal degradation of NIK (<a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib68\" rel=\"#bib68\">Vince et al., 2009</a>). However, structural and in vitro analyses indicate that, unlike TRAF6, the RING domain of TRAF2 is unable to bind E2 conjugating enzymes (<a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib76\" rel=\"#bib76\">Yin et al., 2009</a>), and is therefore unlikely to have intrinsic E3 ligase activity.</p>"},

S1P is generated by sphingosine kinase 1 and 2 (SPHK1 and SPHK2) (<a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib28\" rel=\"#bib28\">Kohama et al., 1998</a>; <a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib33\" rel=\"#bib33\">Liu et al., 2000</a>). Extracellular S1P mainly acts by binding to its five G protein-coupled receptors S1P<sub>1-5</sub> (<a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib25\" rel=\"#bib25\">Hla and Dannenberg, 2012</a>). However, some intracellular roles have been suggested for S1P, including the blocking of the histone deacetylases, HDAC1/2 (<a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib22\" rel=\"#bib22\">Hait et al., 2009</a>) and the induction of apoptosis through interaction with BAK and BAX (<a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib9\" rel=\"#bib9\">Chipuk et al., 2012</a>).</p>"},
          {"content": "<p>Recently, it was suggested that the RING domain of TRAF2 requires S1P as a co-factor for its E3 ligase activity (<a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib3\" rel=\"#bib3\">Alvarez et al., 2010</a>). Alvarez and colleagues proposed that SPHK1 but not SPHK2 is activated by TNF and phosphorylates sphingosine to S1P which in turn&nbsp;binds&nbsp;to the RING domain of TRAF2 and serves as an essential co-factor that was missing in the experiments of Yin <em>et al.</em> Alvarez and colleagues, observed that in the absence of SPHK1, TNF-induced NF-Œ∫B activation was completely abolished.</p>"},
          {"content": "<p>Although we know a lot about TRAF2, there are still important gaps particularly with regard to cell type specificity and in vivo function of TRAF2. Moreover, despite the claims that SPHK1 and its product, S1P, are required for TRAF2 to function as a ubiquitin ligase, the responses of <em>Traf2<sup>-/-&nbsp;</sup></em>and <em>Sphk1<sup>-/-</sup></em> cells to TNF were not compared. Therefore, we undertook an analysis of TRAF2 and SPHK1 function in TNF signalling in a number of different tissues.</p>"},
          {"content": "<p>Surprisingly, we found that neither TRAF2 nor SPHK1 are required for TNF mediated canonical NF-Œ∫B and MAPK signalling in macrophages. However, MEFs, murine dermal fibroblasts (MDFs) and keratinocytes required TRAF2 but not SPHK1 for full strength TNF signalling. In these cell types, absence of TRAF2 caused a delay in TNF-induced activation of NF-Œ∫B and MAPK, and sensitivity to killing by TNF was increased. Absence of TRAF2 in keratinocytes in vivo resulted in psoriasis-like epidermal hyperplasia and skin inflammation. Unlike TNF-dependent genetic inflammatory skin conditions, such as IKK2 epidermal knock-out (<a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib40\" rel=\"#bib40\" title=\"\">Pasparakis et al., 2002</a>) and the <em>cpdm</em> mutant (<a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#bib16\" rel=\"#bib16\">Gerlach et al., 2011</a>), the onset of inflammation was only delayed, and not prevented by deletion of TNF. This early TNF-dependent inflammation is caused by excessive apoptotic but not necroptotic cell death and could be prevented by deletion of <em>Casp8</em>. We observed constitutive activation of NIK and non-canonical NF-Œ∫B in <em>Traf2<sup>-/-&nbsp;</sup></em>keratinocytes which caused production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. We were able to reverse this inflammatory phenotype by simultaneously deleting both <em>Tnf</em> and <em>Nfkb2</em> genes. Our results highlight the important role TRAF2 plays to protect keratinocytes from cell death and to down-regulate inflammatory responses and support the idea that intrinsic defects in keratinocytes can initiate psoriasis-like skin inflammation.</p>"}
