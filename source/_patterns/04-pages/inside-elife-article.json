  "body": "<section class=\"article-section \">    <header class=\"article-section__header\">   <h3 class=\"article-section__header_text\">Letter from the Chairman</h3>   </header>    <div class=\"article-section__body\">   <p>The close of 2016 marks an important landmark for eLife as we transition into our second five-year term. Our first five years focused on building a scientific brand associated with research excellence, transparency and publishing innovation. With the <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/for-the-press/8ee45992/research-funders-renew-commitment-to-transforming-science-publishing\">announcement in 2016 of the renewed support</a> from eLife’s founders, we now move into a second phase where we begin to capitalise on our achievements to date to have broader influence on research communication and achieve our mission to help scientists accelerate discovery.</p>   <p>When considering the current and future influence of eLife, we can look at a number of dimensions. Our core activity is our journal and in 2016 we published over 1,000 research articles for the first time. As eLife approaches the 5th anniversary of publishing, we have been able to grow rapidly and scale an <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/about/peer-review\">editorial process</a> that gets important work published constructively and quickly. And the array of work that we publish continues to encompass the full breadth of biomedical science: amongst 2016’s highlights were the ancient history of viruses, drought-resistance in plants, the neuroscience of anxiety and the demographics of human height. Complementing the science, we have also published influential feature articles, covering topics including the benefits of taking a more open approach in the communication of research outputs. With a strong scientific and editorial foundation, we see tremendous prospects for further growth of eLife’s publishing over the coming years.</p>   <p>Our work with early-career researchers has also gathered momentum in 2016, and it remains a high priority for us to support and learn from this segment of the scientific community. The cultural change that eLife is attempting to foster in science will only be achieved in the longer term, which is why our work with early-career researchers is so important. Amongst many other initiatives, in 2016 we recruited several hundred early-career reviewers to participate in eLife’s unique editorial process. This <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/31a5173b/elife-promotes-early-career-involvement-in-peer-review\">initiative</a> provides an opportunity for early-career researchers to gain experience of peer review, and to share their own valuable insights with other colleagues.</p>   <p>Another dimension of eLife’s impact is progress in technology development. In this area, our goal is to be at the heart of an ecosystem that is driving a more open approach to science. Open infrastructure will be a key part of this and during 2016 we dedicated a little over £1 million of our funding towards the creation of a complete open-source publishing toolset. The first phase of the toolset - named Continuum - was completed in February 2016 and the second phase has just been released. This unique suite of tools will provide eLife with state-of-the-art technology to underpin and explore radical improvements in the design and presentation of content. The tools are also freely available as open-source software for anyone to use. For too long, publishers and suppliers have competed on proprietary solutions to support research communication, with the result that there is much duplication of effort and unnecessary expense. With growing support within the publishing community for open-source software, we hope that Continuum will be adopted as one of the core components of an open and collaborative research communication infrastructure.</p>   <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">   <p>For too long, publishers and suppliers have competed on proprietary solutions to support research communication, with the result that there is much duplication of effort and unnecessary expense.</p>     </blockquote>   <p>There is much more work to be done in the area of product and technology development, and the eLife Board is delighted to see the collaborations that are developing between eLife and established entities such as <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/for-the-press/7e7220f6/elife-partners-with-hypothes-is-to-advance-open-scholarly-annotation\">Hypothes.is</a>. In addition, new early-stage projects are also being identified and selected for collaboration with the eLife team. As above, the common theme that connects all these efforts is a commitment both to open science and to open source software.</p>   <p>With respect to longer term financial sustainability of eLife, important progress was also made in 2016 as we laid the groundwork for the introduction of publication fees in January 2017. By transparently explaining the basis for the calculation of the fee, we have seen an overall positive reaction to the introduction of the fee. Submissions dropped slightly in the first three months of 2017, but at the time of writing, we have already seen a recovery to previous levels. <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/b6365b76/setting-a-fee-for-publication\">The fee will cover the costs of journal growth at eLife</a>, so that more of the eLife’s funding can be used to support other activities, including our efforts to make science more accessible to a broader audience and more useful for others to build on and make discoveries.</p>   <p>eLife is motivated by the potential to make science a more transparent and collaborative enterprise. As a multidisciplinary partnership ourselves, between funders, researchers, publishing teams, developers, designers, and other organisations, eLife is being as transparent and collaborative as possible to help open up science for the World.</p><figure class=\"captioned-asset captioned-asset--inline\">     <img src=\"https://iiif.elifesciences.org/journal-cms:content/2017-06/placeit.jpg/full/full/0/default.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"captioned-asset__image\">      <figcaption class=\"captioned-asset__caption\">    <h6 class=\"caption-text__heading\">Transparent reporting forms will be published alongside articles to help improve reproducibility</h6>        </figcaption>       </figure><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

NIGMS has also implemented a “soft” funding cap where grant applications from investigators who’ve received over $750,000 of funding go through extra scrutiny. This may partly account for why a higher percentage of applicants for NIGMS funding are successful compared with applicants for NIH funding more generally.</p></div></section><section class=\"article-section \">  <header class=\"article-section__header\">  <h3 class=\"article-section__header_text\">Why aren’t early and mid-career researchers getting funded?</h3>  </header>  <div class=\"article-section__body\">  <p>Casey Greene has made several grant applications to the NIH, but to date none have been funded despite the reviews of the applications being reasonably strong. “From my own reviews and from talking to colleagues”, says Greene, “what we’ve seen is an emphasis against risk”. This produces a subtle bias against early-career researchers, because it will always be more risky to fund an early-career researcher than a senior investigator who has worked on similar projects for years. Mid-career researchers are also struggling, but receive less support from the NIH than early-career researchers. “What I’m seeing”, says Bhalla, “is that people will often get their first NIH grant […] but then the big hurdle becomes getting their first or second renewal”.</p></div></section><section class=\"article-section \">  <header class=\"article-section__header\">  <h3 class=\"article-section__header_text\">We still don’t know how best to distribute biomedical funding</h3>  </header>  <div class=\"article-section__body\">  <p>“I think it’s funny that as scientists we spend so much time on our science, but so little time on the science of science”, says Greene. Bhalla agrees: “we need to have more data about what works and what doesn’t work, and we can’t rely on anecdotal data”.</p>  </div>  </section><section class=\"article-section \">  <header class=\"article-section__header\">  <h3 class=\"article-section__header_text\">What can researchers do to improve funding distribution?</h3>  </header>  <div class=\"article-section__body\">  <p>Peifer says researchers should speak up and make their opinions known by, for example, talking to colleagues, writing to the director of the NIH or engaging with scientific societies. However, Greene cautions that “the costs of speaking up can fall differently on different people” – for example, researchers from underrepresented groups may feel that speaking out presents a greater risk of damaging their career – so we cannot blame those who choose not to. <br></p>  <p>Bhalla thinks the culture surrounding the way research is funded needs to change: “I think we’ve lost sight of what we’re supposed to be doing with this money”, she says. What’s needed is a funding system that allows the biomedical community to focus on science and on educating the next generation of researchers.</p>  </div>  </section><section class=\"article-section \">  <header class=\"article-section__header\">  <h3 class=\"article-section__header_text\">Further information</h3>  </header>  <div class=\"article-section__body\">  <p>Take a look at our <a href=\"https://storify.com/eLifeCommunity/addressing-the-early-career-funding-crisis\">post-webinar Twitter chat</a> with the speakers.</p>  <p>Make your views known to the <a href=\"https://acd.od.nih.gov/working-groups/nextgen.html\">Next Generation Researchers Initiative Working Group</a>.</p>  <p>Sign <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/dr-collins-cap-nih-funding-for-individual-investigators-to-save-the-future-of-biomedical-science\">Mark Peifer’s petition</a> in support of an NIH funding cap.</p>  </div>  </section>",
