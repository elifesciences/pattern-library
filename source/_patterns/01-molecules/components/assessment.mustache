  <p>This <strong>valuable</strong> paper informs on the role of type I PRMTs in programming muscle stem cell identification. The evidence presented is mostly <strong>solid</strong>, with some weaknesses in the evidence regarding the proposed mechanism. The paper will be of particular interest to those who study skeletal muscle satellite cell biology.</p>
