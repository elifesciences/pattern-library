An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see <a href=\"#\">review process</a>). Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers."
