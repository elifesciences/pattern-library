/* .listing-column-container contains a .listing-column-main and, where there's secondary content listed,
 *    a .listing-column-secondary, too. It always has bottom spacing of 32px to ensure that the longer of its two
 *    listing columns has that separation between its bottom, and the following UI component.
 *
 * .listing-list is a list of items. It is the major content within a listing column. A listing column may contain one
 *    or more listing lists. Every listing-list in each listing column has a bottom margin expect the last one.
 * NOTE: styles for .listing-list and .listing-list-item now live in listing.scss
 *
 * .listing-column-main contains the primary content lists. On a linearised layout it is the is the top-most content listing
 *    area. On a wider layout it is the main column containing listing content occupying at least the left and central
 *    areas.
 *
 * .listing-column-secondary contains related content. On a linearised layout it falls beneath .listing-column-main;
 *    on a wider layout it occupies 2 adjacent columns below the single column .listing-column-main, and at the widest
 *    layout, it sits to the right hand side of .listing-column-main.
